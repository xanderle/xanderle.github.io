Far away from that certain place and into a world of uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Melbourne, supposedly, has a thriving coffee scene and to be honest it does. However, don’t just expect good coffee wherever you go.\nThe good coffee needs to be sought out through trial and error and perhaps a quick reference to Broadsheet.</p>\n<p>To make life easier, I first looked for good roasters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Market lane</li>\n<li>Padre Coffee</li>\n<li>Seven seeds coffee</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then found places that used those supplies. </p>\n<p>Lucky me I happened to live right next to a Market Lane so off I went!</p>\n<p>Now the first cup was beautiful, everything I wanted in a coffee. Nice foam, not bitter, not burnt, all the subtle flavours alive underneath. Life was good. However, on my second trip it just wasn’t as good. Something was missing, I don’t know what it was but in my pure desperation I decided I would buy a coffee machine and a grinder and stick with my lovely Market Lane beans.</p>\n<p>Oh what a rabbit hole. Initially, I was set on buying a Rancillio Silvia with a PID upgrade and some form of grinder around the $800 mark. Then I discovered lever machines and was instantly encapsulated.</p>\n<p>To become an integral part of the coffee making process seemed like a marvellous idea, to be able to create different flavours by varying the pressure and profile my coffees! What a marvellous idea. I knew the journey ahead would be hard, full of misadventures, bad coffees and frustration, regardless I went through and purchased an La Pavoni Expo 2015 and an Fiorenzato F4 E nano. Armed with absolutely no idea of what I was doing I managed to make it through to a position where I was pleased. It took 2 months but I could regularly pull an espresso shot and be pleased with the results, or at least know where I went wrong.</p>\n<p>Now rather than simply being at peace with this, the rabbit hole demanded more. </p>\n<p>In enters pour overs, cold brew, French presses and syphon coffee.</p>\n<p>Oh dear.</p>\n<p>To begin with I decided to enter with pour overs. Easy sold, simple decision. Except there are two types of pour overs to my understanding, V60 and Chemex. Oh boy, what’s the difference? No idea. Apparently the V60 is more forgiving. HOW IS IT MORE FORGIVING??? </p>\n<p>But pushed by pure impulse I purchased that Chemex, a Stagg kettle, a new bag of coffee and some filters and went on my way.</p>\n<p>Now this is entirely new territory, I don’t know the first thing about it aside from pouring in circles and grinding coarse. I moved my grinder to an arbitrary position that I deemed near the end (the grinder has no markings bar the sharpie line I added on) and ground up 50 grams of coffee and dumped it in my Chemed (after wetting the filter of course). Armed with my electric temperature controlled kettle I poured in circles completely oblivious to what I was doing. I knew blooming was a thing so I poured for a bit then stopped and watched as it bubbled up. Hind sight is 20/20 I probably should have knocked the grounds a bit to maybe flatten them before pouring but push on! </p>\n<p>After pouring and swirling for about 5 minutes I decided that was about enough water and watched it drip through. </p>\n<p>Due to the fineness of the grind I realised I had ground far too fine for this job. But I waited for it to drip through then tried it…</p>\n<p>And I wasn’t disappointed! but I wasn’t completely blown away, it didn’t taste terrible and it was pleasant. But there was definitely a lack of the flavour descriptors on the bag of coffee.</p>\n<p>Not to be dissuaded, my adventure continues.</p>\n<p>For the future I know to grind finer and perhaps place my instructions not on the same device that I’m using to keep track of time!</p>\n<p>Until next time!</p>","excerpt":"Let there be Coffee!
