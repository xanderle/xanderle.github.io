This month it has been about learning Haskell, learning OCaml, starting a blog (HEY I DID IT?!?!?), improving my machine learning skills, and gain an AWS certification.\nOh and making an app in SwiftUI, forgot about that one, and recently I’ve been thinking about trying to write a very basic self hosted server less implementation (how hard can it be?).</p>\n<p>So armed with my tendency to attempt 1000 things and forget about them. Im hoping by logging everything I can remind myself of the things I’m doing and keep myself going on the tasks I’ve started.</p>\n<p>So from everything I’ve done this month, lets make a list of what I might actually do this month.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn Haskell</li>\n<li>Prepare for the AWS Cloud Architect associate exam</li>\n<li>Make a tool to take Apple notes and convert them to markdown for my Gatsby Blog (see trying to do everything)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So writing an app in SwiftUI seems like a great idea, but its still in beta and as a result it is hard to code out apps since they change things as they go along (for instance they changed the method call for making a modal appear). Until SwiftUI gets out of beta I might just skip that one out</p>\n<p>Learning Haskell to me isn’t about learning the syntax of Haskell, its about learning another paradigm. No offence to Object Orientated Programming, but I hate it, mainly because of Java.\n￼\n<img src=\"images/problemfactory.jpg\" alt=\"problem-factory\">\nBut that entire rant is for a different post.\nSo as a result I would like to learn a functional programming language, so that makes the list.</p>\n<p>Now I have a fair amount of experience with AWS, I’ve worked with it for about a year and I did it as a unit at uni.\nI however, don’t believe this makes me an absolute savant at AWS, so I’m looking to improve my skills and obtain a bit of paper in the process. Towards this goal I’ve signed up to A Cloud Guru, I’ll share how that goes and what I’ve learn post exam.</p>\n<p>For the automatic notes to markdown for Gatsby, I have an iPhone. That means I can write in notes wherever I am. The ability to write in notes, tag them with a “ready to publish” and have them automatically deployed to my Gatsby site would be sick. I have literally zero idea how to do this, but that won’t stop me.</p>\n<p>So that’s my tasks for the month, whilst I try work full time and go to the gym everyday… wish my luck!</p>","excerpt":"All the Projects!
